##Introduction 
A very simple game. Once you open our game, you will see 6 X 6 total 36 boxes. When you click a box, it will show you a number. All you need to do is matching those boxes with the same numbers. Once you findout a pair of boxes and click them, they will disappear, and you will see a part of the image which behide them. Finally, after you find and match all of them, you will see the full image.

## Purpose of the software includes

### type of software development process is applied:
- We chose the **waterfall** to become our software development process.
### Why we chose this type?
- It is because we want to ensure the quality of our game. We never as a team before, we did not know each other's strengths. Therefore, in order to ensure the quality of the project, we need to propose a full well plan, hence we chose waterfall as our software development process.
### Possible usage of our software
- Nowadays people have more stressful in daily life, no matter adult, student, or even children and usually, they do not have enough time to relax themself. Therefore we want to invent a game that is more time-efficient and simple to let everyone can take a rest anytime, anyplace.
